# Incorrect Comparison in MyMethod()

This repository demonstrates a common error in C#: an incorrect comparison operator in a conditional statement. The `MyMethod()` function contains a bug where it only executes a certain block of code if `MyProperty` is strictly greater than 10, when it should also execute if it is equal to 10. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential logical errors.  The solution demonstrates the corrected code with the correct comparison operator.
